# Using This Template
	1. Replace this readme with a description of the paper
2. Rename the file `samplepaper.tex` to something more meaningful
3. Replace `samplepaper.pdf` in the `.gitignore` file so you don't end
   up checking in the built PDF file.
3. Edit the author section including emails, thanks and running header
4. Update `sldg.bib` if needed.  Pull from repo before updating to get
   latest entries.  Push back to the lab repo if you add entries. 
5. Some includes are commented out as they are not always needed.
   Uncomment what you need and add others as needed. 
6. If you do not want to use `natbib` remove `\usepackage{natbib}`,
   add `\usepackage{cite}`, and swap `bibliographystyle` commands at
   the end of the document.
   
There is currently no `Makefile` for this template because the build
is trivial.  Feel free to add one if you are so inclined.
