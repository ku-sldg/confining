# Attempting to recapture the specification of Paul Rowe's paper titled "Confining Adversary Actions via Measurements"

My version is created in tandam with Dr. Alexander's previous work as well as our current thoughts. 

## Notes Mar 8 2022
Perry and I discussed adding a module system to hold all axioms and parameters in the confining paper to generalize about specifications for future systems. So, I started thinking about this idea and created the file `module.v` Upon working in this file, I realized I need to better understand the system in the `confining` paper before abstracting it. I plan to keep going on the `confining` specification in the coming days.
